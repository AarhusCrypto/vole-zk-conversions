# **swanky**: A suite of rust libraries for secure multi-party computation

**swanky** provides a suite of rust libraries for doing secure multi-party
computation (MPC).

* **fancy-garbling**: Boolean and arithmetic garbled circuits.
  * **twopac**: Two-party garbled-circuit-based secure computation.
* **humidor**: Implementation of the Ligero zero knowledge proof system.
* **keyed_arena**: Bump allocator which allows for random access to its allocations.
* **ocelot**: Oblivious transfer and oblivious PRFs.
* **popsicle**: Private-set intersection.
* **scuttlebutt**: Core MPC-related primitives used by various **swanky** libraries.
* **simple-arith-circuit**: Simple flat arithmetic circuit representation.

# A Note on Security

**swanky** is currently considered **prototype** software. Do not deploy it in
production, or trust it with sensitive data.
